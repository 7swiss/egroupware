  * added valid timezone set in php.ini check
  * show package changelog inside EGroupware under about
  * feature to show contact_id in list and editview; ability to sort by contact_id, ability to search for contact_id (or parts of it), so beware if you search for a contact by id, you may find more than one, since the number you search for may be part of the content of more than one field and contacts, as numbers can occur also in eg.: phonenumber, roomnumber, ZIP-Code, ...

  * Add wizard for creating export definitions
  * Add a 'No notifications' checkbox to infolog edit dialog to avoid sending notifications

  * fixed not shown bugdet in project-list, if user has no explicit role, eg. the creator
  * ACL (default to noone) to set ticket creator
  * calendar sitemgr integration: planner module now able to preselect resources to; prevent planner with no owner preselected
  * additional logout button and new theme with more contrast (bold) for topmenu items in Stylite template
  * merged Nathans commit including my fix, as it fixes not working filemanager favorites to dirs with single quotes: only quote urlencoded single quotes, if we use egw_link_handler, if not quoting destroys the links!!!
  * Stylite template: only send admin sidebox, for admin index url (when clicked on admin)

  * Calendar: database UPDATE
  *   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ALL SYNCML USERS. PLEASE READ!
  *   All users who sync their devices with SyncML have to be aware that an 
  *   "initial sync" will be necessary on any synced device directly after the 
  *   next update of an EGroupware instance.
  *   GroupDAV devices should be updated automatically and there are no 
  *   further things to do for GroupDAV devices.
  *   Which updates are affected?
  *   Updates from EPL9.1 Packages to current EPL9.2 released after 11.th Feb.2010
  *   Updates from EPL9.2 Packages prior to 11.th Feb. 2010 to current EPL9.2
  *   released after 11.th Feb. 2010
  *   Updates from any official version <= 1.6.002
  *   - to future 1.6.003
  *   - to current SVN versions [branch (Revision 29097) or trunk (Revision 29096)]
  *   Updates from any SVN version
  *   - to current SVN versions [branch (Revision 29097) or trunk (Revision 29096)]
  *   Reason:
  *   In current EGroupware versions (<= 1.6002) we did not fully match the 
  *   iCal RFC on calendar entries. This caused some hard to resolve problems 
  *   for syncing the calendar entries. With the next update we change the 
  *   contents of the calendar's UID and RECURRENCE-ID database fields to fit 
  *   the iCal RFC.
  *   Here's some advice on performing the next EGroupware update:
  *   - let your SyncML users perform a last sync before EGroupware gets updated
  *   - tell your users to not change any entries on the sync devices until 
  *   the update is finished
  *   - after the update, let your users perform an "initial sync" on every 
  *   device; this means to let the sync remove all the contents on the device 
  *   and refresh it with the server data; this can be done by a setting on 
  *   your device
